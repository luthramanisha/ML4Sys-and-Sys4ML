# Second Workshop on ML for Systems AND Systems for ML 

The rapid advances in machine learning (ML) have significantly increased its adoption across various fields including data systems, both in academia and industry. These advancements have not only enhanced existing data systems but, in some cases, have completely transformed their internal components, leading to the development of an important field of “learned data system components” in the ML for Systems area. Similarly, a well-structured systems approach has also played a crucial role in advancing current ML techniques and systems, forming the basis for the Systems for the ML area.

The workshop aims to bring together renowned researchers both by means of keynotes and invited talks to discuss and debate intriguing topics at the core of the two focus areas. The open format for submitting abstracts from anything like a position paper to technical experiences allows for lively debates and discussions as well as fosters collaborations among participants to work on common topics. The speakers are expected to also share insights into their ongoing projects and the open research challenges they are currently addressing. 

**A key objective of this workshop is to promote interaction between all attendees—whether they are presenting authors, keynote or invited speakers, or other participants—to foster new collaborations.**
