# Second Workshop on ML4Sys and Sys4ML

## Workshop Description

The rapid advances in machine learning (ML) have significantly increased its adoption across various fields including data systems, both in academia and industry. These advancements have not only enhanced existing data systems but, in some cases, have completely transformed their internal components, leading to the development of an important field of “learned data system components” in the ML for Systems area. Similarly, a well-structured systems approach has also played a crucial role in advancing current ML techniques and systems, forming the basis for the Systems for the ML area.

The workshop aims to bring together renowned researchers both by means of keynotes and invited talks to discuss and debate intriguing topics at the core of the two focus areas. The open format for submitting abstracts from anything like a position paper to technical experiences allows for lively debates and discussions as well as fosters collaborations among participants to work on common topics. The speakers are expected to also share insights into their ongoing projects and the open research challenges they are currently addressing. 

**A key objective of this workshop is to promote interaction between all attendees—whether they are presenting authors, keynote or invited speakers, or other participants—to foster new collaborations.**

## Call for Abstracts

This year in the ML4Sys and Sys4ML workshop we are calling for **one-page abstract** submissions that can be anything from a position paper representing a novel vision about a viewpoint or a controversial topic, a summary of lessons learned by working on a research area, an open research problem, or technical experience working on a large system (academic or industry). The requirements for the abstracts is as follows 

- a one-page abstract on an exciting research or industry problem for the submission, and
- a short summary about the author (short bio) including corresponding work done related to the problem. Links to the author’s homepage and/or LinkedIn can be also included.

Additionally, you can submit a 2-minute video about the position paper, e.g., by demonstration or including a presentation about their work. Instead of a video, a maximum of 3 slides explaining the idea can also be submitted.
